# my_printf
my_printf | Epitech projet

Rebuild the printf function from the C library according to the C99 standard. 

The project could be used just as same as printf.

I didn't push the int main
If you wanna try, just add 
int main()
{
  my_printf(...);
  return (0);
}
in the my_printf.c

and then "make re" for compilation
